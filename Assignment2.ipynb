    "- How many records are in the entire trace?\n",
    "- What is the duration of the entire trace ?\n",
    "- Add print-screens of 3 examples of packets that are NOT part of the attack. Explain what are those packets.\n",
    "- What are the characteristics of the attack (aka fingerprint)? Remember: the fingerprint are the characteristics that most repeats targeting a single destination IP. Traffic FROM the victim to the IP addresses in the network trace are NOT part of the attack. Tip: isolate 1 source and 1 destination IP and see if the same pattern applies to the other source IP addresses.\n",

    "- Which top 3 source IP addresses sent more packets in the attack?\n",
    "- Where are these top 3 source IP geolocated?\n",
    "- Which Autonomous Systems are related to these top 3 source IP addresses?\n",
    "- What is the distribution of vendors related to the source IP addresses involved in the attack? Tip: use MAC address to Vendor. Ask Google.\n",
    "- What is/are the source port(s) involved in the attack?\n",
    "- How much was the data rate peak of the attack [Mbits/second]?\n",
    "- What is the distribution/frequency of TCP flags involved in the attack?\n",
    "- What is the distribution/frequency of packet length (\"total length\")?"
